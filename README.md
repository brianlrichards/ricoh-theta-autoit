ricoh-theta-autoit
==================

[AutoIt 3.x](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) script for batch processing using the [Ricoh Theta for Windows](https://theta360.com/de/support/download/) GUI application

Copy the script `theta_xmp.au3` into the directory with the 360Â° panoramic images 
copied from the Ricoh Theta camera, then launch it (usually by double clicking).
It will scan the directory and - for every JPG image that does not yet have an 
accompanying _xmp.jpg file - generate it using the *Ricoh Theta for Windows* 
application.

The generated files will be **auto-levelled** and contain the **XMP metadata** necessary to
turn the images into photospheres and/or use them with [Mapillary](http://blog.mapillary.com/update/2014/09/10/support-for-pano.html).

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/neuhaus/ricoh-theta-autoit/wiki) for
download links.

Make great pictures and have fun!<br>
